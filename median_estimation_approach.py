# I'm gong to share a solution that I found interesting with you.
# The idea is to compute the median of the series in different window sizes at the end of the series,
# and the window sizes are increasing exponentially with the base of golden ratio.
# Then a median of these medians is taken as the estimate for the next 60 days.
# This code's result has the score of around 45 on public leaderboard, but I could get upto 44.8 by playing with it.
